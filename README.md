Encrypted, signed, backups.

dependencies

 - tar
 - age
 - signify

usage
------
making a backup archive:

	$ cat list_of_files_to_backup | bup.sh backup_name
	tar: Removing leading / from absolute path names in the archive
	Enter passphrase (leave empty to autogenerate a secure one):
	Using the autogenerated passphrase "palace-must-stay-muscle-achieve-edge-hub-ethics-box-rate".

the following files will have been created in the current directory:

 - `yyyy-mm-dd.pub`          - public keyfile for signature verification
 - `backup_name.tgz.age`     - encrypted archive
 - `backup_name.tgz.age.sig` - signature of encrypted archive

decyrption:

	$ bup.sh open backup_name.tgz.age yyyy-mm-dd.pub
	Signature Verified
	Enter passphrase:

the script will verify the signature, decrypt and extract the tgz archive all at once.

alternatively, you can just decrypt the archive itself, without extracting by passing a third argument (path to the decrypted archive):

	$ bup.sh open backup_name.tgz.age yyyy-mm-dd.pub ./test.tgz
	Signature Verified
	Enter passphrase:
